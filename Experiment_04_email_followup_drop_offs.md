Experiment 07 -- Recovery Email - You missed something within {x minutes}
====================================================

Hypothesis - Engage while momentum is still there
--------------------------------------------------

-   **Reach**: 90% of users that don't convert ~27000 (send audience)\

-   **Impact**: 7/10

-   **Confidence**: 9/10

-   **Effort**: 2/10

## We have high drop offs so the target audience is quite big

From general market data - email open rates are as follows:\
Welcome email open rate: ~45--60% (13,000)\
Feature updates or upgrade nudges: ~25--40%\
Re-engagement emails: ~15--25%

An email from a know sender (business)has a CTR between 4-8% - The potential to recover the customer and get them back to the flow could be big. Between 600 & 1050 clicks per day out of the 13,000 that opened it.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Hypothesis\
I only received an email related to TradeZella 24 hours after my first drop off. And this didn't mention anything about welcome or my Subscription process.\
The momentum was already gone.\
By reminding to our users that there's a unique value proposition when signing up can help recreate the initial momentum. We can get customers to come to the paywall again and select to see a Demo instead of paying.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Implementation\
Looks like you haven't completed your subscription yet. A quick reminder that our users have consistently reported that:

- top traders don't guess, they track\
- 60% of TradeZella users hit profitability in 6 months.

ðŸ“ˆ Primary Metric
-----------------
- CTR and Conversion would be the primary metrics to track


## ðŸ’¡ Risks\
- It's possible that the window of 30 minutes is either too short or too long. It's possible that we need to trigger this email sooner.\
- The email can be perceived as noise as we already welcomed the user the moment they gave us their email.
