# Experiment 03 ‚Äì Streamline Sign-Up Flow
## Hypothesis - Reduce Sign-Up Steps

By removing unnecessary celebration and interstitial steps from the initial sign-up flow, we will reduce friction and user confusion, leading to a higher conversion rate from sign-up to subscription.

- **Reach**: 32,000 monthly
- **Impact**: 6/10
- **Confidence**: 6/10
- **Effort**: 4/10 (some steps need to be moved to activation)

## üéØ Problem Addressed
The current sign-up journey creates a jarring and conflicting experience for new users. After providing their credentials, users encounter premature celebration screens (one on desktop, two on mobile) before they have seen the product or its value.

This celebration is immediately followed by a paywall, which creates cognitive dissonance. The user is congratulated, only to be instantly asked for money. This can erode trust and create the feeling of a "bait-and-switch." The final step, which promises to "show you what you can achieve," is ineffective as it gates that value behind the paywall the user is about to see.

##  üí° Solution Hypothesis
My solution is to create a more direct and transparent path from sign-up to the subscription page. By removing the superfluous steps, we believe users will have a clearer understanding of the next action (subscribing) and will be less likely to drop off due to confusion or a negative emotional experience.

## Implementation Steps:
- Remove Pre-Paywall Celebrations: Eliminate the celebration screen(s) that appear after initial credential submission.
- Remove Redundant Value Prop Screen: Cut the "Let‚Äôs show you what you can achieve" step before the paywall.
- Create Direct Path: Funnel users directly from the sign-up completion to the subscription plan selection page.

## üìä Primary Metric
Sign-Up ‚Üí Subscription Conversion Rate: The primary goal is to increase the percentage of users who subscribe after signing up.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation
Risk: Loss of Customer Insights. The removed steps might be collecting valuable data on user personas or goals. Removing them means we lose this data point for users who don't convert.

Mitigation: This data can be collected more effectively during activation, where users are more invested. Alternatively, we can integrate these questions as an optional, low-friction part of the subscription page itself.

Risk: Reduced Positive Reinforcement. While premature, the celebration might create some positive momentum. Removing it could make the flow feel more transactional.

Mitigation: We will A/B test this change against the current flow to measure the actual impact on user sentiment and conversion. We can also enhance the welcome messaging on the subscription page to be encouraging without being a full-screen, unearned celebration.

## ‚úÖ Prioritization & Rollout Strategy
Given the low effort and potentially high impact, this experiment cab be a high-priority candidate for testing.
We still need to include these steps in the activation process so I would discuss with the team what the effort would be in this case.
