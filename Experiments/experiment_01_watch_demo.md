# Growth Strategy: Sign-Up to Subscription Conversion

## 🎯 Objective
Increase the **Sign-Up → Subscription Conversion Rate** by reducing friction and improving perceived value. 
Main beneficiaries are all the new accounts but we could see higher impact for newbies that hesitate to commit..

## 🎯 Why
Competitors offer either Free plans or tier based free plans (number of traders imported). It's essential to listen to our customers and offer a way to explore / try before paying. 
We are getting numerous comments in YouTube about affordability, cheaper plans free access. 
Allowing customers to explore could be one of the fastest ways to validate if Free plan, Tier based Freemiums are the way to move forward to increase conversion.

## 🚀 Experiment 1: Watch Demo Access

### Hypothesis
Giving new users the ability to **watch a demo** or **experience the app** before hitting the paywall will increase conversion by showing the great UX, functionality convincing why the App is worth paying for! The demo account will have a paywall on the most prominent CTAs like Add Trades etc.

### RICE Score
- **Reach**: 32000
- **Impact**: 10/10
- **Confidence**: 10/10
- **Effort**: 4/10 Medium (Demo account already exists)

---

## 🔍 Problem Addressed
- New/inexperienced traders don't perceive the immediate value of a trading journal.
- They hesitate to pay for something they haven't seen in action.
- Current paywall is a hard blocker with no product interaction or "aha moment".

---

## 💡 Solution Hypothesis
Introduce a **“Watch Demo” / “Experience Before You Buy” flow**:
- Demo mode of core features (journaling, AI analysis)
- Subtle CTAs to remove the current hard blocker
- Exploration of key screens before committing

## 👥 Audience Insight

| < 1 year (newbies)      | 38,000           |
| 1–3 years               | 27,000           |
| 3–5 years               | 9,000            |
| 5+ years (advanced)     | 5,000            |

This shows the biggest upside lies in converting **new and somewhat inexperienced users**.

| Implementation Steps | Title                               | Description                                                                 |
|------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Have a Look First CTA**           | Add a CTA option on sign up paywall to have a look first walkthrough            |
| 2    | **View Product Demo**               | Demo version with sample data (read-only mode)                             |
| 3    | **Beginner Package Highlight**      | Highlight and recommend entry-level package based on trader experience - Needs separate experimentation    |
| 4    | **Success Stories/Testimonial Block** | Add carousel/testimonials pre-paywall to build trust - Needs separate experimentation                       |
| 5    | **Email Follow-ups with Demo Links** | Redirect users back to demo instead of static paywall in emails - - Needs separate experimentation           |

## ✅ Prioritization & Rollout Strategy

| Phase       | Action Item                            | Effort | Priority |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1     | Add “Have a Look First” CTA             | Low    | High     |
|             | Highlight beginner package(separate exp)| Low    | High     |
|             | Add testimonial block (separate exp)    | Low    | High     |
| Phase 2     | Rework follow-up email journey          | Low    | Medium   |

**Note: If the conversion from the SaaS paywall proves to be better then as easy follow up would be to try merging the sign up paywall with the saas paywall.**

## 🧠 Notes / Risks
- The testimonials, Social Proof, Slogans can be tested separately as a broader social proof experiment. This will reduce the scope and effort. (cannot run at the same time)
- The Plan recommendation based on experience level can be tested separately as sign up personalization initiative
- The email recovery flow can be tested as a separate experiment to reduce the scope effort.(can run at the same time)
- It's possible that we could identify if the paywall is a hard block by offering a 14 days money back guarantee.
- It's possible that we could show a video instead of the demo account and still have similar results. 
- There's many ways of removing the blocker...
