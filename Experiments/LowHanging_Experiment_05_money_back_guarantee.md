Experiment 04 -- Money-Back Guarantee Banner
===========================================

Hypothesis - Reduce Purchase Friction with a Guarantee
------------------------------------------------------

By adding a prominent money-back guarantee banner on the plan selection screen, we will reduce the perceived financial risk for new users, which will increase the sign-up to subscription conversion rate.

-   **Reach**: All users reaching the plan selection/paywall screen.

-   **Impact**: 7/10

-   **Confidence**: 8/10

-   **Effort**: 1/10

üéØ Problem Addressed
--------------------

Users, especially those new to trading journals, are often hesitant to commit to a paid subscription without being 100% certain of the product's value to them. This hesitation at the point of purchase is a major friction point that leads to drop-offs, even for users who are otherwise interested.

üí° Solution Hypothesis
----------------------

We will introduce a clear and trustworthy "30-Day Money-Back Guarantee" banner on the pricing page. This acts as a safety net, removing the primary objection of financial risk and encouraging users to complete the subscription process with confidence.

### Implementation Steps:

1.  **Design Banner:** Create a simple, visually distinct banner with clear text (e.g., "100% Satisfaction Guaranteed. Get a full refund within 30 days, no questions asked.").

2.  **Place Banner:** Position the banner in a high-visibility location on the plan selection screen, near the call-to-action buttons.

3.  **Update T&Cs:** Ensure our terms and conditions are updated to reflect this policy.

üìà Primary Metric
-----------------

-   **Sign-Up ‚Üí Subscription Conversion Rate**: The percentage of users who successfully subscribe after creating an account.

‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation
---------------------

-   **Risk: Increased Refund Rate.** Offering a guarantee may lead to a higher number of refund requests.

    -   **Mitigation:** This is also a valuable data source. We will monitor the refund rate closely. If it spikes, we will analyze the reasons for refunds to identify and fix underlying issues in the product or onboarding experience.

-   **Risk: Operational Overhead.** Processing refunds requires manual effort.

    -   **Mitigation:** We will create a streamlined, semi-automated process for handling refund requests to minimize the operational burden.

‚úÖ Prioritization & Rollout Strategy
-----------------------------------

This is a classic "quick win" experiment. Given the extremely low effort and high potential for impact, this should be prioritized for immediate implementation and testing.
