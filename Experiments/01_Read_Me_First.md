## Here's how to navigate this deployment. 
- The default and prioritised experiment is 01_watch_demo

- The second is 02_trust_reinforcement. You can view the second experiment by enabling the feature flag in the url **?exp_add_social_proof_signup=true**

- The 03_steamline_sign_up is about removing more steps from the sign up so there are no visuals to it. Just a hypothesis and extra information

- 04_email_follow_up_drop_offs can we reviewed in the figma file. I am simply reusing some of the templates you already have and changed the copy and CTA - link to figma file: https://www.figma.com/design/PNzUt1NEN3rgIXnR2xNxTM/ActiveNomads---accommodation---co-working?node-id=707-2

- 05_money_back_guarantee can be activated online using the feature flag **?exp_growth_money_back_guarantee=true**

For the rest I just added the hypothesis without proceeding to any designs or code implementation. They are very simple low hanging fruits that I would love to test. Some of these ideas are coming from my experience of over 2000+ experiments at Booking.com and Miro.com.


Thank you for this opportunity!
