# Growth Strategy: Sign-Up to Subscription Conversion

## 🎯 Objective
Increase the **Sign-Up → Subscription Conversion Rate** by reducing friction and improving perceived value. 
Main beneficiaries newbies but this can help every lead that hesitates to commit..

## 🎯 Why
Competitors offer either Free plans or tier based free plans (number of traders imported). It's essential to listen to our customers and offer a way to explore / try before paying. 
We are getting numerous comments in YouTube about affordability, cheaper plans free access. 
Allowing customers to explore could be one of the fastest ways to validate if Free plan, Tier based Freemiums are the way to move forward to increase conversion.

## 🚀 Experiment 1: Watch Demo Access

### Hypothesis

### RICE Score
- **Reach**: 32000
- **Impact**: 10/10
- **Confidence**: 10/10

## 🔍 Problem Addressed
- New/inexperienced traders don't perceive the immediate value of a trading journal.
- They hesitate to pay for something they haven't seen.
- Current paywall is a hard blocker with no product interaction or "aha moment".

Introduce a **“Watch Demo” / “Experience Before You Buy” flow**:
- Demo mode of core features (journaling, AI analysis)
- Testimonials & success stories of beginners
- Default recommendation of beginner package
- Exploration of key screens before committing

## 🧠 Notes / concerns
- The testimonials, review score, Slogans can be tested separately to reduce the scope effort. (cannot run at the same time)
- The email recovery flow can be tested as a separate experiment to reduce the scope effort.(can run at the same time)
- It's possible that we could identify if the paywall is a hard block by offering a 14 days money back guarantee. 
- Freemium requires more effort as 0 auth payments and/or license limitations needs to be coded
- Designed to maximize value-per-effort by focusing on beginner conversion.
- Will serve as foundation for future personalization or segmentation efforts.
