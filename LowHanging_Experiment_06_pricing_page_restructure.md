Experiment 06 -- Pricing Page Redesign
=====================================

Hypothesis - Optimize Pricing Page for Conversion
-------------------------------------------------

By redesigning the pricing page to be more compact, visually appealing, and to display key product features "above the fold," we will increase the flow of qualified, high-intent users into the sign-up process.

-   **Reach**: All users visiting the pricing page (~10% of sign-up flow entrants).

-   **Impact**: 7/10

-   **Confidence**: 7/10

-   **Effort**: 5/10

üéØ Problem Addressed
--------------------

The current pricing page is underperforming as a source for sign-ups. Key issues include:

1.  **Poor Information Hierarchy:** Core product features are not visible on a standard laptop screen without scrolling.

2.  **Usability Bugs:** The page suffers from layout issues that detract from its professionalism and usability.

3.  **Lack of Clarity:** The page doesn't effectively communicate the value proposition of each plan, forcing users to work hard to understand what they're buying.

üí° Solution Hypothesis
----------------------

A complete redesign of the pricing page will fix these fundamental usability issues and create a more effective on-ramp to the sign-up flow. A user who understands the pricing and features before signing up is more likely to convert.

### Implementation Steps:

1.  **Compact Design:** Create a new layout that presents the different plans and their most important features in a clear, comparable format above the fold.

2.  **Feature Highlighting:** For each plan, clearly list the key features and benefits, using icons and concise copy.

3.  **Fix Layout Bugs:** Ensure the new design is fully responsive and free of the usability issues plaguing the current page.

4.  **Clear CTAs:** Each plan should have a prominent and clear call-to-action (e.g., "Start Free Trial," "Choose Pro").

üìà Primary Metric
-----------------

-   **Pricing Page ‚Üí Sign-Up Flow CTR**: The percentage of users who click through from the redesigned pricing page to start the sign-up process.

-   **Secondary Metric**: Final Sign-Up ‚Üí Subscription Conversion Rate for users who came from the pricing page.

‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation
---------------------

-   **Risk: Scope Creep.** A "redesign" can easily become a larger project than anticipated.

    -   **Mitigation:** We will define a clear and limited scope for the V1 redesign, focusing only on the most critical elements: layout, above-the-fold content, and bug fixes.

-   **Risk: Over-complication.** Adding too much information could overwhelm the user.

    -   **Mitigation:** The design will prioritize clarity and simplicity. We will use user feedback and A/B testing to find the right balance of information.
