We want to showcase and experiment demonstrating the value of experiencing the product first before hitting the paywall. 

🎯 Problem Addressed
New/inexperienced traders don't perceive the immediate value of a trading journal.
They hesitate to pay for something abstract they've never experienced.
Current paywall is a hard blocker with no product interaction → no “aha” moment.

💡 Solution Hypothesis

Introducing a “Watch Demo” or “Experience Before You Buy” instead of a paywall. 
the onboarding will have progress steps on top, indicating the active steps and the finish with a checkmark celebrate icon. 

The UI: 

Add a simple login screen with admin admin as user name and password. Once provided then we move to the first step: 

Every step includes:
Logo top navigation bar with a logout option. I will provide the logo image and I will share the current steps and their design by naming the files step1.jpg step2.jpg etc.

We will use 4 horizontal steps. 
Each step will a header copy and a description line. Each choice will be a small card ui. 
We want to apply the principle of 60/30/10 for the colours
Here’s some of the colours the applicaiton is currently using: 

Background: linear-gradient(177deg, #161828 0%, #242B66 82.25%)
Primary CTA sidebar: #6853B5
Secondary CTA : #2959db
