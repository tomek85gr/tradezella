# Experiment 02 – Trust & Value Reinforcement on Mobile

## Hypothesis - Branded / Trust Authority

- **Reach**: 32,000 monthly
- **Impact**: 8/10
- **Confidence**: 8/10
- **Effort**: 2/10

---

## 🎯 Problem Addressed

- Majority of users come through **direct** or **branded organic search**, meaning they are already familiar with TradeZella and arrive with **high intent**.
- However, the **value proposition is not reinforced** at key conversion moments like the paywall.
- Trust-based decisions are important — traders are more likely to adopt tools **recommended by successful peers**.
- Current flow **asks for a commitment (pay)** without restating *why* it’s worth it.

## 💡 Solution Hypothesis

Reinforce trust and value **at the paywall** and in key screens to nudge conversions from high-intent users.

### Tactics:
- **Include SaaS review score** (e.g. G2, Trustpilot) in the footer
- **“Recommended by” line** with avatars or names of trusted traders
- **Reinforce product value with strong copy**, e.g.:
  - _“Top traders don’t guess. They track.”_
  - _“60% of TradeZella users hit profitability in 6 months.”_
- Show 2-3 **testimonial quotes** from successful traders, optimized for visibility

---

## ✅ Recommendation

- Quick Win: Add **trust indicators** (reviews + “recommended by”) in the footer
- Mid-term: Add **impact copy** and **testimonials** near the plan selection/paywall
- These experiment could run in combination and together with the first experiment of showing a Demo to users.

## Risks

- USPs and Review score to be perceived as noise, pushing too much to gain trust can have the opposite impact.
